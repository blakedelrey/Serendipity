Book Inventory Management System

Description: This application is an inventory management system for a fake bookstore called Serendipity.
             The user of this application can add books with various pieces of information to the database, which can then have its information edited,
             deleted, or even updated upon the selling of a book.
             Information of all books can be viewed at any time as well as in depth information on any individual book after searching.
             
Project information: This project was written in 2018 as one of my first object oriented programs to help me learn the concepts of pointers, classes, linked lists,
                     and various other rudimentary concepts of programming. The code is not pretty as this was created when I was first learning to program
                     but the program is very functional and will not break upon any form of user input.
                     
To use application: If you would like to download and use the application for yourself, please downlaod the executable file Serendipity.exe and the database.txt file together.
